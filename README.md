The dataset for this work is taken from the open-source website, the dataset is called as the [Sign-language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist), available on Kaggle. The dataset is patterned to
match with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0–25) as a oneto-one map for each alphabetic letter A–Z (and no cases for J = 9 or Z = 25
because of gesture motions).
